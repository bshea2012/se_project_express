# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end portion of the "What to Wear?" project. The project was setup with express.js. A server was created using MongoDB and setting up a database for creating users and adding/removing items to add for the user profile. A schema was created for both the user and the items added for the project. Routing and controllers were used to configure requests and sending back responses from the server. Testing the server responses was done with Postman. Overall, this project was to handle a user creating a profile and then within the app, the user will be able to add/remove items and this back-end to handle adding these to a database, with error global and custom error handlers to ensure a smooth functionality.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
